# Heart-Disease-Prediction
In order to transform our idea into reality, we have used certain technologies. Firstly, to predict whether the person is suffering from a heart disease or not, we’ve used a Machine Learning algorithm namely Logistic Regression. It is a supervised learning classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a target variable. The working accuracy of this algorithm came out to be 85%. After predicting, we found out that maximum number of people are at the risk of having a heart problem. 
Secondly, we’ve built a web page using Html and CSS for the login details of the user which would be asking for their ‘Name’ and ‘email Id’. Then we’ve provided a button which would direct them to the form which is built again using html and CSS, where the user is going to fill in his/her details. After filling the details the user will submit the form and based on our predictions he/she will get to know whether they are suffering or maybe at a verge of having a heart disease or not. If yes, then we’ve suggested certain measures that they can take in order to avoid any further problem.
Now in order to make this web application available to the user, we’ve deployed both ML model and Web page using ‘FLASK’ framework.
